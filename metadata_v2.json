Putting the onus of re-cycling of electronics wastes (e-wastes) on the producers, the rules make the e-waste producers liable for recycling and reducing e-waste in the country. The rules cover discarded IT and telecoms equipment and consumer electrical goods and encompass the concept of Extended Producers Responsibility or the Polluter Pays Principle which as applicable in relation of e-wastes, makes the producers to take responsibility for the disposal of end-of-life products. Personal Computer manufacturers, mubile handset makers and the white goods makers will be required to come up with e-waste collection centers or introduce take back systems. These rules will apply to every producer, and bulk consumer involved in manufacture, sales. purchase and processing of electronic equipment or components. 2. According to the\"2011 Census around 32.6% of the households in Kerala have both land line and mobile phone connectivity, while the national average is only 11.7%, Kerala has 20.4% computer connectivity, as against national average of 18.7%. e-wastes are fast becoming a major solid waste sueam in the State. Among them Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and Fluorescent Tube Lights (FTL) engage special attention and disposal tactics due to the mercury contained in them. The following types of wastes are generated from the fluorescent lamp sector: 3 (i) Glass Waste (with and without mercury} (it) Waste phosphor powder (ii) Waste mercury (in liquid and vapour phase) (iv) Waste electronic and plastic components. Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and Fluorescent Tube Lights (FTL) due to its mercury content pose health risk if handled carelessly, as mercury may enter living systems causing irreversible damages and may even prove to be fatal. The CPCB guidelines specify that the waste generated at the manufacturers end shal] be stered and treated/recycled either in a recycling unit at the production site or any authorized Lamp Recycling Unit and all hazardous waste thereof shall be sent to Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) set up as per the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Transboundary) Rules, 2008. Mercury emissions are strictly controjled during the manufacturing stage of CFL&FTL and stringent measures should be followed by units at the time of disposal of hazardous wastes containing mercury. At present fused CFLs /FTLs are posing a difficult situation to manage by local bodies since it is being dumped into municipal solid waste dumping sites very carelessly by the public and is endangering public health. This situation has warranted the Government to evolve a proper procedure to collect fused CFLs/FTLs and dispose them of scientifically and safely. The way forward for consumers would be turning in old mercury lamps of all types particularly conventional Fluorescent Tube Lights and CFLs to ensure proper transport and disposal availing the service of the Ministry of Environment authorized agencies for collection and storage of e-wastes, avoiding situations creating direct contact of broken CFLs and FTLs by users and others. 3. Since Kerala doesnt have an e-waste disposal plant, the waste goes into the unorganized market for crude dismantling, recovery and reuse. This create several occupational health hazards. As the States consumption pattern increases, scientific management of e-waste becomes very critical. The problem of e-waste has been growing rapidly in the State and the end users especially offices and residents are facing practical difficulties in disposing of them in an environmentally sound manner. 4. In the matter of safe collection, storage, transportation and scientific disposal of the e-wastes generated in the State, Government issue the following orders for strict and urgent compliance by all concerned: pone"

Often broken CFLs and FPLs are put up in the house hold solid wastes harming those who collect the same and those handling it at disposal facilities. As proper collection, storage and transportation of c-wasles is of direct consequence to the LSGIs they may provide the required basic facility for house hold level segregated collection and local storage of e-wastes to be taken fo reprocessing units by registered agencies. Local Self Government Institutions may provide the minimum required storage facilities for the e-wastes to be collected from the ward level residential/commercial areas aad thase segregaied from the MSW (v3} (vii Waste Electronie/Electrical Material > and also facilities for centralized collection of e-wastes from the local collection centers.

Forward linkages are now available for collection from central collection points in urban areas, to be taken to dismantling and disposal] units. Space may be arranged near local markets or landed properties owned by LSGIs, from where the wastes can be collected and stored at a central collection point [or each LSGI, to be taken delivery of by the accredited state level agencies for collection and transportation and disposal or to collect and transport to centralized disposal facilities. Thequestion of paymient of some monetary incentives to those who collect income generating e-wastes from house holds, by the state level agencies to be engaged can also be considered. for which the LSGIs providing space for centralized storage may negotiate with such agencies. Some recyclers extend the facility of entermg into agreement with corporate and .Government organizations to collect, transport and dispose of e-wastes. They may aiso give incative for the types of e-wastes which will provide them income on reprocessing. Each category may have different rate depending on its recyclable value. Usually the following e-wastes are eligible for payment by registered recyclers/authorized collection agents.

Likewise the Kerala State Wide Area Network (KSWAN), provides connectivity up to Taluk level offices and these entities notified as critical information Infrastructure of the state. In consonance with National Cyber Security Policy, 2013 both the State Data Centers have been ISO 27001 certified and periodic audits of the network infrastructure and co-hosted servers are performed quarterly by Third Party Security auditors, in addition to being subjected to STQC auditing annually. These measures will only ensure security of the cyber infrastructure but the security of the application software is not ensured through the above audits. 2. Currently both the data Centers host around 500 portals / websites / applications catering to the requirement of respective Government Departments/Organizations, These are either developed/managed by Total Solution Provider like NIC, KELTRON, C-DIT or developed and managed by third party companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys etc and perhaps a few by home grown Startup companies. In addition to the web-based applications, Mobile applications (some standalone and some having a corresponding back-end console and reporting functionalities) are also getting developed for the state. In the applications so developed, there exists a possibility of cyber-attack due to flaws in the design, development and deployment of application. The vulnerabilities thus created may be exploited by intruders with malicious intent to cause defacements, data corruption, data/information leakage and disruption in service continuity, threat to data security and privacy."

    "text": "3. In order to mitigate or minimize the cyber threats and to plug the vulnerabilities Government issued the following guidelines with regard to security auditing of websites and web and mobile based e-Governance applications: L III. Any e-Governance application to be hosted at the SDCs or elsewhere shall be security audited before launching in Production and mandates to obtain Safe to host Certification from a CERT-In empanelled Security Auditing agency before opening the application to the public. Security Audits and penetration testing are required to be performed followed by subsequent hardening aimed to mitigate the vulnerabilities and strengthening the security of the applications and their environment. As a policy, all websites / applications hosted at the State Data Centres have to go through a complete security audit process before they can be hosted or whenever an alteration/addition is made to the application. Periodic application security audits shall be done, at least once every two years. The security audit / penetration testing is undertaken at various stages before, during and after hosting. Before hosting, Security audit of Web Application is done as per latest OWASP standard and report is submitted with vulnerabilities that require remediation. A second level testing for verification of whether all the discovered vulnerabilities are patched is also done before Issuance of Certificate of Safe to Host During hosting, Configuration review / SSL deployment, Random Penetration Testing of hosted application etc. also are done. Application Security Audit covers some or all but not limited to the following activities: e Identify the application level vulnerabilities on applications hosted in a test site / production site based on the latest top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities e On demand application scans e An audit of the environment along with the application to ascertain any vulnerability in the environment where the application is hosted. e Password strength on authentication pages e Scan Java Script for security vulnerabilities e File inclusion attacks e Web server information security e Malicious File Uploads e Provide recommendations for remediation of identified vulnerabilities. The report should contain discovered vulnerabilities and description of vulnerabilities and mitigation or remediation recommendations for fixing and patching of existing and found vulnerabilities as a part of solution. e Follow a specific format for reports. e Certify the applications / websites tested as Safe for Hosting and in times if Electronic Payment Gateway Operators request to provide it in their format. e Accept responsibility for declaring the websites / URLs / mobile applications free from known vulnerabilities e Any other activity concerning security audit related aspects; not essentially covered by work-areas outlined above."

IT policy of government of Kerala has emphasized on availing the enormous potential of Information Technology as a tool to improve governance and thereby ensure responsive and citizen friendly administration. In line with this, state government has initiated measures to computerise various government departments. It has been decided that leading companies in IT sector may be entitled as Total Solution Providers to carry out the task. Departments will be approaching these agencies for assistance in implementing IT solutions. As per the IT policy of the state and the Task Force Report on IT implementation in Government, government computerisation should pave way to develop a strong IT industrial base in the state. Also for the computerisation programme to deliver tangible results it should be carried out in a time bound manner. In this scenario, possibility of enlisting organisations belonging to private sector of Kerala, as TSPs may be explored. This will act as a catalyst to boost the emerging IT companies in the state. Also, Departments will be privileged to make a choice from wider range of excellent service providers. This is the right time to channel investments in the IT industry to Kerala. By IT implementation in Government departments, government itself will evolve as a new market for IT products and services. This will effect in projecting Kerala as the ideal destination for new entrepreneurs in IT industry as envisaged in IT policy. According to the report on IT procurement in government, the TSPs will be advised to outsource a certain portion of their activities to local firms. This will result in employment generation to a large extent.

Overview This policy defines the backup policy for computers co-located in the e- Governance Data Centre, Govt. of Kerala. These systems are typically servers with internal hard disks / disk arrays or SAN / NAS based storages Servers expected to be hacked up include database servers, application servers, web servers, mail servers etc. 2. Purpose This policy is designed to protect data in the computers to be sure it is not lost and can be recovered in the event of an equipment failure, intentional destruction of dala, or disaster in the data centre. 3. Definitions (i) Backup - The saving of files onto magnetic tape or other offline mass storage media for the purpose of preventing loss of data in the event of equipment failure or destruction, (ii) Archival - The saving of old or unused files onto magnetic tape or other offline mass storage media for the purpose of releasing on-line storage room. (iti} Restore - The process of bringing off line storage data back from the offline media =  and pulling it on an online storage system. (iv) Storage replication - Storage replication is a service in which stored or archived data is duplicated in real time over a storage area network. Storage replication service provides an extra measure of redundancy that can be invaluable if the main storage backup system fails. Storage replication may be done in the same storage uray, different storage array/s in the same location or a storage array in a remote location. Immediate access to the replicated data minimizes downtime and its associated costs. The service, if properly implemented, can streamline disaster recovery processes by generating duplicate copies of all backed-up files on a continuous basis. It can also speed up and simplify recovery from a natural or human-caused disaster such as a fire, flood, hurricane, virus, or worm. (v) Disaster Recovery - The process, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of technology infrastructure critical to an organization aller a natural or human induced disaster. Disaster recovery planning is a subset ola larger process known as business continuity planning, and should include planning for resumption of applications, data, hardware, communications (such as networking) and other IT infrastructure. A business continuity plan (BCP) includes planning for non-IT related aspects such as key personnel, facilities, crisis communication and reputation protection, and should refer to the disaster recovery plan (DRP) for [T related infrastructure recovery / continuity."

Minutes of the meeting held by the Secretary (IT) on 24.06.2017. ORDER As per Government order read 1 paper above, concurrence of Electronics & IT Department is mandated for the projects involving purchase of computers, servers and other related peripherals, software development / upgradation, AMC of Computers and peripherals etc. for which the estimated cost is above Rs. 10 lakh. As per Circulars read as 24 and 3\" paper above, it was reiterated that consultation with Electronics & IT Department is not required for projects below Rs. 10 lakh. This amount was fixed 18 years back. Hence there is a general demand to raise the limit. As per the Government order read 2\"4 paper, guidelines were issued for implementation of e-governance initiatives by departments and organizations. But it is observed that these guidelines are not being-observed and general tendency is to forward files to Information Technology department without proper evaluation or vetting. Also, files related to a particular project is forwarded multiple times to IT department even when the project has been considered in the working group and DPC meetings in which IT department's nominee participate. This is adding up the work at different levels besides delaying the project implementation. It is observed that the process for obtaining concurrence of ITD need to be streamlined to overcome the present procedural delays. In this circumstance, Government are pleased to revise the existing guidelines and departments shall adhere to the following procedure to obtain concurrence of IT department: Project cost e Total project cost of the IT initiatives for which concurrence of ITD is required is enhanced fromRs. 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs.

ORDER In Government Orders referred to above, orders were issued adopting CPWD and MORTH guidelines for preparation of estimates of public works. In the Circular second cited, detailed guidelines have been issued to process proposals being considered by Government Tender Committee. The CVC guidelines prescribe that single tenders shall not normally be accepted for the first time, and the same can be considered for acceptance only in emergent situations that' too subject to recording of detailed justifications in support of acceptance with the approval of competent authority. It has been observed that some of the Government departments/PSus are accepting single tenders without observing prescribed procedures. The cannons of financial propriety and public policy demand that single tender shall not be accepted first time as no price discovery happens due to absence of competition. Furthermore, defective tender conditions or. inadequate publicity can also result in single tenders."

    "text": "-.4 A common reason for single tender might be the restrictive specifications which do not permit multiple vendors to participate. Therefore, all Government Departments/Agencies/PSUS are hereby directed to ensure that tenders floated by them shall not contain any restrictive specifications. They shall also ensure that adequate publicity is given for all public procurements. 4. In order to streamline the procedure on acceptance of single tender/bids for public works, the following guidelines are issued with immediate effect: (a) Definition of single tender: The terms \"tender\" and \"bid\" are used interchangeably in the context of public procurement. Consequent to invitation of tenders, if only one bid is received or only one bid is found eligible after technical evaluation, such a bid shall be termed as a single tender/bid. (b)Opening of single bids: i. if a single bid is received during the first invitation, authority inviting the bid shall not open the bid. The authority may either opt to re-tender the work or extend the last date for acceptance by 15 working days to elicit response of other prospective bidders. The last date for acceptance of the bid will be automatically extended by 15 working days by default if single response is received, unless specified otherwise in advance by the tender inviting authority. If any response(s) is/are received during the extended period then, the bids may be eyaluated taking the earlier bid and subsequent bids"

NIC shall make necessary changes. in the e-tender portal to facilitate the above processes. - Acceptance of single bid below estimate rate: Since different Government Departments/Agencies/PSUS do not follow uniform pattern in the preparation of estimates, a single bid received even below estimate rate need not reflect market price in the absence of competition. Hence, single bid at the estimate rate or below ER shall also not normally be accepted during the first invitation. Second or subsequent invitation of tenders (Re-tendering): Before re-tendering, the Tender Inviting Authority shall analyse the possible cause(s) for not receiving sufficient number of bids and thoroughly verify the tender conditions to rule out any restrictive clauses/conditions in the original tender document. The tender inviting authority should ensure that adequate publicity is given for re-tender and prospective bidders may be alerted through both e-mail and SMS. When re-tendering is done, the bid submission period may be cut short to ten working days. Single bid in a re-tender can be accepted keeping'in view the CVC guidelines and instructions issued by Government from time to time. However, a single bid during re-tender shall be accepted only with the approval of Committee of Secretaries/"

The collection of additional deposits is a disincentive to the bidder who offers to execute a work below estimated rate and this will induce the contractor to quote a rate equal to or higher than estimated rate.

Knowledge based Innovation and Entrepreneurship The Science and Technology driven Innovation comes under a broad category of innovation definition called Knowledge based Innovation. It is critical to bring in this definition as we are in a Knowledge economy and there are other factors which impact the development of Science and technology based inventions and breakthroughs to the region. The Information technology start ups , essentially belong to the second category enterprises discussed above and seem to be bringing about disruptions in the sectors they are emerging. These innovators are today equipped with the power of Internet and developments in Information technology and hardware devices. They seem to be creating a market pull in unexpected directions and the convergence of ICT, mobility and cloud technologies seem to be favouring the same. The thrust effected by re-engineered business models in the concerned sectors has been tremendous. In hospitality, we have the largest accommodation provider who doesnt own a property and in Media we have the largest media company, which doesnt have a production facility. These were models unthought-of or written off not too long ago and similar disruptions are happening in education, healthcare and all such sectors."

    "text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template 1Purpose Purpose of this document is to explain the features of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) process. This document discusses the flow of the new QCBS process. 2Methods for Selecting the Bidder The methods that are used for selecting the bidder are as follows: 2.1Quality and Cost Based Selection Quality and Cost Based Selection, a method that takes into account the quality of the proposal and the cost of the services, is the commonly recommended method for the selection of bidder. However, for cases where QCBS is not the most appropriate, other methods of selection are applied. 2.2Quality Based Selection Quality Based Selection (QBS) is a method based on evaluating only the quality of the technical proposals and the subsequent negotiation of the financial terms and the contract with the highest ranked bidder. QBS should be applied only for the following types of assignments: Complex or highly specialized assignments for which it is difficult to define in the tender documents and the required input from the bidder Assignments where the downstream impact is so large that the quality of the service is of overriding importance for the outcome of the project (for example, engineering design of major infrastructure) Assignments that can be carried out in substantially different ways such that financial proposals maybe difficult to compare Assignments including supervision of large and complex construction works for which it is particularly important to take safety measures 3Evaluation of Technical Proposals Technical evaluation process includes the following steps: 3.1Receipt of Proposals The technical and financial proposals shall be submitted in separate sealed envelopes at the same time. The financial proposals shall remain sealed until evaluation of the technical proposals is completed. Page 3 of 32"

Any proposal received by the tender inviting authority after the deadline for submission shall be returned unopened. 3.3Evaluation of Technical Proposals The evaluation of technical proposals is summarized in this Chapter. The criteria for the evaluation of technical proposals shall normally include the following items: Experience of the bidder: Bidders general experience and record in the field covered by the tender document Adequacy of methodology and work plan: Adequacy of the proposed approach, methodology and work plan Qualifications and competence of staff: Experience and records of the staff members to be assigned to the work. The criterion shall be further divided into the following sub-criteria: General qualifications: This includes education, length of experience, types of position held, and length of service with the firm, etc Suitability for the project: This includes experience of performing the duties which will be assigned to them in the project Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country: Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country in which the work is to be performed or experience in similar environments. The technical evaluation report shall normally give detailed information on the following items, supplementing the summary evaluation sheet: Evaluation Committee or other similar organization, if any, responsible for the evaluation, and the domestic laws, ordinances or orders which govern the establishment and/or functioning of the Committee or other similar organization Evaluation criteria and relative weight distribution, with reasons for adopting each criterion and the basis for deciding the weight distribution Rating: Reason for arriving at the rating given for each item for each firm A proposal shall be rejected at the stage of evaluation of the technical proposals, if the technical proposal fails to achieve the minimum technical score or is considered non- responsive to the invitation requirements. Additional criteria may be applied depending on the nature of the assignment. In such case, additional criteria may include, but not limited to, the following: Suitability of transfer of knowledge: Suitability of the transfer of knowledge (training) programs Page 4 of 32"

Table below shows the general examples for the range of points allocated to the criteria on a scale of 1 to 100. The actual weight may be adjusted to the characteristics of the specific project. The points allocated to each evaluation criterion and sub-criterion should be specified.

The use of excessively detailed lists of sub-criteria may render the evaluation a mechanical exercise more than a professional assessment of the proposals. It is recommended that the number of sub-criteria be kept to a minimum (typically no more than three for each criterion) and that no fewer than three points be allocated to each sub-criterion. Table below summarizes the evaluation criteria and sample sub-criteria.

When evaluating staff members, only those conducting essential part of the assignment are recommended to be evaluated. Evaluating staff members with relatively low importance is not recommended, because the relative importance of the essential members will decrease.

When QCBS is applied, moreover, it is important to secure that financial proposals must be compared only among the proposals achieving the minimum qualifying technical score in order to maintain the acceptable level of quality. 3.3.5Setting the Grades for Experience of the Bidder Since all bidders are on the Short List based on their experience, they are not normally rated at less than \"Average\", that is not less than 70%.

In the case of QCBS, review and concurrence shall be given before public opening of the financial proposals. 4Evaluation of Financial Proposals Financial evaluation process includes the following steps: 4.1Public Opening of Financial Proposals The bidders who have secured the minimum qualifying technical score will be advised of the location, date, and time for opening of the financial proposals. The financial proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of the bidders who choose to attend. The name of the bidders, the technical quality scores, and the proposed prices shall be announced and recorded. 4.2Evaluation of Financial Proposals and Determination of Financial Score In determining the financial score, the evaluator shall review the congruency of the technical and financial proposals, make adjustments as appropriate, and correct arithmetical or computational errors. The lowest evaluated financial proposal will receive the maximum score of 100 points. The score for each other financial proposal is inversely proportional to its evaluated total price. With regard to the issues of local taxes, for the purpose of evaluation, cost shall exclude local identifiable indirect taxes (all indirect taxes levied on the contract invoices, at National, State (or Provincial) and Municipal levels) on the contract and income tax payable to the country of the concern authority on the remuneration of services rendered in the country of the concern authority by non-resident staff of the bidder, as indicated in the Guidelines. During the verification process, financial proposals are first checked for compliance with the Data Sheet. Each financial proposal must include provisional sums and contingencies in the amounts specified on the Data Sheet and must be exclusive of local taxes, and the validity period of the proposals must accord with the validity period set down in the Data Sheet. A review is then made to ensure that the figures provided in each financial proposal are consistent with the details of the corresponding technical proposal (e.g., personnel schedule inputs, number and duration of field trips, applicable per Diems, etc.). The following are taken into account to ensure a fair competition among price proposals: If the inputs shown in the financial proposal for any expert do not match those shown on the personnel schedule in the technical proposal, the personnel schedule inputs shall prevail and adjustments will be made to the financial proposal accordingly.

    "text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template If an expert included in the technical proposal is omitted from the GFP, then the cost of that expert is included in the bidders financial proposal at the highest rate for that position among all the financial proposals. When QCBS is applied, a minimum of man-months required for bidders at client place and bidders place is included in the Data Sheet. If the total client and/or bidder inputs shown on the personnel schedule are below those indicated in the Data Sheet, an adjustment will be made for the missing man-months using the highest remuneration rate per month. If the number of trips and per diems calculated from the personnel schedule does not match the quantities for these items shown in the GFP, adjustments will be made to the GFP inputs in accordance with the personnel schedule. Finally, a review is made for computational errors, and the final amount is considered as the gross evaluated financial proposal (GEFP) . GEFPs will be converted into net evaluated financial proposals (NEFPs) . NEFPs include only variable cost items such as remuneration and reimbursable expenses. Fixed cost items such as provisional sums and contingencies are not included. NEFPs are calculated by subtracting the provisional sums and contingencies (non-competitive components) shown in the Data Sheet from the GEFPs, and by converting to a single currency using the selling rates of exchange, source and date indicated in the Data Sheet. 4.3Determination of Total Score and Ranking of Proposals The lowest NEFP is then given a maximum score of 100 points. This is then used as a basis to calculate the score of the other financial proposals. The financial score for each proposal is inversely proportional to its NEFP, that is, the higher the NEFP, the lower the financial score. The financial score is computed as follows: Financial Score NEFP of the lowest priced proposal = 100 points Each other NEFP =100 points xNEFP of the lowest priced proposal NEFP of the proposal under considerations An example is shown below: NEFP of lowest priced proposal = INR 80 Lakhs NEFP of second lowest priced proposal = INR 85 Lakhs Financial score of the lowest priced NEFP = 100 points Page 19 of 32"

The weight for the cost shall be chosen, taking into account the complexity of the assignment and the relative importance of quality. It shall normally be 20%. If financial proposals contain unreasonably low price, the authority should ask the concerned bidder for clarification of such an offer and should receive answers from the bidder to ensure appropriate execution during the contract stage, before concluding the evaluation.

Statistics clearly shows that hackers all over the world are targeting websites of various Governments and India stands among the top in the list of affected nations. Since the Government of Kerala is quite advanced in e- Governance and set a role model for other States in India, continuous defacements of websites show the Government in poor light in terms of security of its &-Governance domain. 2. While analyzing the defaced websites, it is found that all of them are. hosted outside the State Data Centres and majority of these are developed using. Joomla and other open source Content Management Framework. Mostly, the attacks are a result of the security patches for the software platform and framework not being updated on the servers. Security vulnerabilities in a'website/application hosted in a co-hosting server at State Data Centre may adversely affect other applications hosted on the same server which may lead to mass defacement. . 3. Due to the increase in the number of defacement of Government websites, Safe to Host Security Audit certificate has been mandated for hosting websites/applications in State Data Centres under Kerala State IT Mission. At both - State Data Centres, different levels of security measures have been implemented at both server and network layer which has significantly helped reduce security threats."

Knowledge based innovation and Entrepreneurship The Science and Technology driven Innovation comes under a broad category of innovation definition called Knowledge based Innovation. It is critical to bring in this definition as we are in a Knowledge economy and there are other factors which impact the development of Science and technology based inventions and breakthroughs to a land. The Information technology start ups, essentially belong to the second category enterprises discussed above and seem to be bringing about disruptions in the sectors they are emerging. These innovators are today equipped with the power of Internet and developments in Information technology and hardware devices. They seem to be creating a market pull in unexpected directions and the convergence of ICT, mobility and cloud technologies seem to be favoring the same. The thrust effected by re-engineered business models in the concerned sectors has been tremendous. In hospitality we have the largest accommodation provider who doesnt own a property and in Media we have the largest media company, which doesnt have a production facility. These were models unthought-of or written off not too long ago and similar disruptions are happening in education, healthcare and all such sectors. 1.2, Kerala Technology Startup Policy Kerala Technology Start-Up Policy now in place unfolds the broad framework for creation of a startup ecosystem in technology based startups across sectors in state of Kerala. The Policy is split into nine sections that are the strategic building blocks towards a world-class startup ecosystem viz., Infrastructure, Incubators and Accelerators, Human Capital Development, Funding, State Support, Governance, Public Private Partnership, Scaling Existing and Establishing New Incubators and Startup-Bootup-Scaleup model for moving fast from ideas to IPO. 1.3.

Technology innovation Zone Government of Kerala is establishing the Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, a global innovation incubator hub for multiple domains and technology sectors under a single roof. The zone will create world-class infrastructure facilities for multi sector technology incubators to incubate their start-ups and to support home grown enterprises. We also expect the cross pollination of ideas and technology breakthroughs to trigger high value innovations/startups. Kerala Technology Innovation Zone is envisioned as a one stop shop for technology innovation, where everything from the consolidating of the idea, to its incubation, to mentor support for setting up a successful enterprise and even a squadron of angel investors ready to invest- in a bankable idea is present. The TIZ acts as a Self- sustained ecosystem which serves all the interests of the young innovators and entrepreneurs, so that all the time and energy that they have, goes into product development and not the peripherals such as worrying about the Jaw and lack of funding or infrastructural support. 3.3.  Fab Kerala Network Govt. of Kerala through Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has setup two Fablabs each at Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram and Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, Kochi. Fablab Thiruvananthapuram is located at the ground floor of Indian Institute of Information Technology Management (IITM-K), Fablab Kochi is located in the ground floor of Water Tank Building, Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, KINFRA Hitch Park, Kochi. By setting up the Fablab Kerala Network it is envisaged to encourage the innovation, technology development, product prototyping, maker learning, and commerciziable product developnient. This will empower the maker-entrepreneurial culture, which at present is confined to ICT/ electronics domain. The Fablab programme will lead to a cross learning culture among multiple technology sectors and create a robust platform for the upcoming entrepreneurs to create indigenous technology products. The Kerala fablabs are a support facility for the maker community comprising of student, -startups, entrepreneurs, corporates, individual makers, research groups, academic institutions and universities across India.

On the other end we have R&D institutions and agencies working on cutting edge technologies that are creating intellectual property and advancements in varioius technologies for their own research or operations. These advancements however do not come out for the common good of the society nor does it translate to commercial businesses. The system will have provisions to capture such latent talents and innovations and bring them to the forefront. The biggest triggering force of commercially successful business is a societal pain point, every time an innovation addresses a problem faced by the public in a way better than it is being done currently there isa ready market/ opportunity.
