      "original_text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template 1Purpose Purpose of this document is to explain the features of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) process. This document discusses the flow of the new QCBS process. 2Methods for Selecting the Bidder The methods that are used for selecting the bidder are as follows: 2.1Quality and Cost Based Selection Quality and Cost Based Selection, a method that takes into account the quality of the proposal and the cost of the services, is the commonly recommended method for the selection of bidder. However, for cases where QCBS is not the most appropriate, other methods of selection are applied. 2.2Quality Based Selection Quality Based Selection (QBS) is a method based on evaluating only the quality of the technical proposals and the subsequent negotiation of the financial terms and the contract with the highest ranked bidder. QBS should be applied only for the following types of assignments: Complex or highly specialized assignments for which it is difficult to define in the tender documents and the required input from the bidder Assignments where the downstream impact is so large that the quality of the service is of overriding importance for the outcome of the project (for example, engineering design of major infrastructure) Assignments that can be carried out in substantially different ways such that financial proposals maybe difficult to compare Assignments including supervision of large and complex construction works for which it is particularly important to take safety measures 3Evaluation of Technical Proposals Technical evaluation process includes the following steps: 3.1Receipt of Proposals The technical and financial proposals shall be submitted in separate sealed envelopes at the same time. The financial proposals shall remain sealed until evaluation of the technical proposals is completed. Page 3 of 32",

      "original_text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template 3.2Opening of Technical Proposals The technical proposals shall be opened on the bid opening date. Any proposal received by the tender inviting authority after the deadline for submission shall be returned unopened. 3.3Evaluation of Technical Proposals The evaluation of technical proposals is summarized in this Chapter. The criteria for the evaluation of technical proposals shall normally include the following items: Experience of the bidder: Bidders general experience and record in the field covered by the tender document Adequacy of methodology and work plan: Adequacy of the proposed approach, methodology and work plan Qualifications and competence of staff: Experience and records of the staff members to be assigned to the work. The criterion shall be further divided into the following sub-criteria: General qualifications: This includes education, length of experience, types of position held, and length of service with the firm, etc Suitability for the project: This includes experience of performing the duties which will be assigned to them in the project Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country: Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country in which the work is to be performed or experience in similar environments. The technical evaluation report shall normally give detailed information on the following items, supplementing the summary evaluation sheet: Evaluation Committee or other similar organization, if any, responsible for the evaluation, and the domestic laws, ordinances or orders which govern the establishment and/or functioning of the Committee or other similar organization Evaluation criteria and relative weight distribution, with reasons for adopting each criterion and the basis for deciding the weight distribution Rating: Reason for arriving at the rating given for each item for each firm A proposal shall be rejected at the stage of evaluation of the technical proposals, if the technical proposal fails to achieve the minimum technical score or is considered non- responsive to the invitation requirements. Additional criteria may be applied depending on the nature of the assignment. In such case, additional criteria may include, but not limited to, the following: Suitability of transfer of knowledge: Suitability of the transfer of knowledge (training) programs Page 4 of 32",

      "original_text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template Support facilities and organization: Support facilities and organization of the bidder including support resources at Head office Proposal presentation: Overall quality of the presentation of the proposal The weight distribution of additional criteria should be determined by taking into account their relative importance to the criteria Experience of the bidder, Adequacy of methodology and work plan, and Qualifications and competence of staff, and each additional criterion should normally not exceed 10 points out of 100 points. Table below shows the general examples for the range of points allocated to the criteria on a scale of 1 to 100. The actual weight may be adjusted to the characteristics of the specific project. The points allocated to each evaluation criterion and sub-criterion should be specified. Table 1: Point Distribution of Evaluation Criteria for Technical Proposals Evaluation Criteria Points (weights) a.Experience of the bidder 10 to 20 b.Adequacy of methodology and work plan 20 to 50 c.Qualifications and competence of staff 30 to 60 d.Suitability of the transfer  optional Normally not exceed 10 e.Support facilities and organization  optional Normally not exceed 10 f.Proposal presentation  optional Normally not exceed 10 Total 100 The evaluation criteria other than (c), i.e., (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) may also be divided into sub-criteria, but such division should be limited only to the essential factors. The use of excessively detailed lists of sub-criteria may render the evaluation a mechanical exercise more than a professional assessment of the proposals. It is recommended that the number of sub-criteria be kept to a minimum (typically no more than three for each criterion) and that no fewer than three points be allocated to each sub-criterion. Table below summarizes the evaluation criteria and sample sub-criteria.

When evaluating staff members, only those conducting essential part of the assignment are recommended to be evaluated. Evaluating staff members with relatively low importance is not recommended, because the relative importance of the essential members will decrease. The qualifications and competence of staff shall be evaluated using the following three sub- criteria to be set up according to the required qualifications and tasks for each position: General qualifications: This includes education, length of experience, types of position held, and length of service with the bidder, etc. Suitability for the project: This includes experiences of performing the duties which will be assigned to them in the project Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country: Familiarity with the language and the conditions of the country in which the work is to be performed or experience in similar environments A sample range of percentage for the above sub-criteria is shown in table below.

Any change of the minimum technical score during the evaluation process shall not be allowed. When QCBS is applied, moreover, it is important to secure that financial proposals must be compared only among the proposals achieving the minimum qualifying technical score in order to maintain the acceptable level of quality. 3.3.5Setting the Grades for Experience of the Bidder Since all bidders are on the Short List based on their experience, they are not normally rated at less than \"Average\", that is not less than 70%.

The name of the bidders, the technical quality scores, and the proposed prices shall be announced and recorded. 4.2Evaluation of Financial Proposals and Determination of Financial Score In determining the financial score, the evaluator shall review the congruency of the technical and financial proposals, make adjustments as appropriate, and correct arithmetical or computational errors. The lowest evaluated financial proposal will receive the maximum score of 100 points. The score for each other financial proposal is inversely proportional to its evaluated total price. With regard to the issues of local taxes, for the purpose of evaluation, cost shall exclude local identifiable indirect taxes (all indirect taxes levied on the contract invoices, at National, State (or Provincial) and Municipal levels) on the contract and income tax payable to the country of the concern authority on the remuneration of services rendered in the country of the concern authority by non-resident staff of the bidder, as indicated in the Guidelines. During the verification process, financial proposals are first checked for compliance with the Data Sheet. Each financial proposal must include provisional sums and contingencies in the amounts specified on the Data Sheet and must be exclusive of local taxes, and the validity period of the proposals must accord with the validity period set down in the Data Sheet. A review is then made to ensure that the figures provided in each financial proposal are consistent with the details of the corresponding technical proposal (e.g., personnel schedule inputs, number and duration of field trips, applicable per Diems, etc.). The following are taken into account to ensure a fair competition among price proposals: If the inputs shown in the financial proposal for any expert do not match those shown on the personnel schedule in the technical proposal, the personnel schedule inputs shall prevail and adjustments will be made to the financial proposal accordingly.

      "original_text": "Prototype Document for QCBS Template If an expert included in the technical proposal is omitted from the GFP, then the cost of that expert is included in the bidders financial proposal at the highest rate for that position among all the financial proposals. When QCBS is applied, a minimum of man-months required for bidders at client place and bidders place is included in the Data Sheet. If the total client and/or bidder inputs shown on the personnel schedule are below those indicated in the Data Sheet, an adjustment will be made for the missing man-months using the highest remuneration rate per month. If the number of trips and per diems calculated from the personnel schedule does not match the quantities for these items shown in the GFP, adjustments will be made to the GFP inputs in accordance with the personnel schedule. Finally, a review is made for computational errors, and the final amount is considered as the gross evaluated financial proposal (GEFP) . GEFPs will be converted into net evaluated financial proposals (NEFPs) . NEFPs include only variable cost items such as remuneration and reimbursable expenses. Fixed cost items such as provisional sums and contingencies are not included. NEFPs are calculated by subtracting the provisional sums and contingencies (non-competitive components) shown in the Data Sheet from the GEFPs, and by converting to a single currency using the selling rates of exchange, source and date indicated in the Data Sheet. 4.3Determination of Total Score and Ranking of Proposals The lowest NEFP is then given a maximum score of 100 points. This is then used as a basis to calculate the score of the other financial proposals. The financial score for each proposal is inversely proportional to its NEFP, that is, the higher the NEFP, the lower the financial score. The financial score is computed as follows: Financial Score NEFP of the lowest priced proposal = 100 points Each other NEFP =100 points xNEFP of the lowest priced proposal NEFP of the proposal under considerations An example is shown below: NEFP of lowest priced proposal = INR 80 Lakhs NEFP of second lowest priced proposal = INR 85 Lakhs Financial score of the lowest priced NEFP = 100 points Page 19 of 32",

The weight for the cost shall be chosen, taking into account the complexity of the assignment and the relative importance of quality. It shall normally be 20%. If financial proposals contain unreasonably low price, the authority should ask the concerned bidder for clarification of such an offer and should receive answers from the bidder to ensure appropriate execution during the contract stage, before concluding the evaluation. The total score is computed as follows: Total Score Technical score x Weight + Financial score x Weight An example is shown below: Weight for quality: 80%, Weight for cost: 20% Minimum qualifying technical score: 70 points Technical score Bidder XXX: [Technical score] 68.90 points ===> disqualified Bidder YYY: [Technical score] 88.48 points, [NEFP] INR 85 Lakhs Bidder ZZZ: [Technical score] 81.72 points, [NEFP] INR 80 Lakhs In this case, the total score of Bidder No. 2 and Bidder No. 3 are computed as follows: Financial Score Bidder YYY: 94.12 points Bidder ZZZ: 100.00 points Total Score Bidder YYY: 88.48 points x 80% + 94.12 points x 20% = 89.61 points Bidder ZZZ: 81.72 points x 80% + 100.00 points x 20% = 85.38 points Once the final scores for each proposal have been calculated, they can be ranked from highest to lowest.
