Information Technology (IT Cell) Department G.O.(Ms) No. 43/2015ATD Dated, Thiruvananthapuram, 01.10.2015. Read: - 1. G.O.(P) No.24/2009/ITD dated 29.09. 2009. 2. G.O.(Rt) No.17/2011ITD dated 24.01.2011. - 3. Minutes of the meeting of the Apex Committee on &-Govemance held on 16.07.2015. ORDER More than 50 websites under Government of Kerala were defaced in the month of April, 2015. Statistics clearly shows that hackers all over the world are targeting websites of various Governments and India stands among the top in the list of affected nations. Since the Government of Kerala is quite advanced in e- Governance and set a role model for other States in India, continuous defacements of websites show the Government in poor light in terms of security of its &-Governance domain. 2. While analyzing the defaced websites, it is found that all of them are. hosted outside the State Data Centres and majority of these are developed using. Joomla and other open source Content Management Framework. Mostly, the attacks are a result of the security patches for the software platform and framework not being updated on the servers. Security vulnerabilities in a'website/application hosted in a co-hosting server at State Data Centre may adversely affect other applications hosted on the same server which may lead to mass defacement. . 3. Due to the increase in the number of defacement of Government websites, Safe to Host Security Audit certificate has been mandated for hosting websites/applications in State Data Centres under Kerala State IT Mission. At both - State Data Centres, different levels of security measures have been implemented at both server and network layer which has significantly helped reduce security threats.",
