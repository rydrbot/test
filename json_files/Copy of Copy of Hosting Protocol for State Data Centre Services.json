      "original_text": "2 Introduction State Data Centre (SDC) has been identified as one of the important element of the core infrastructure for supporting e -Governance initiatives of National e -Government Plan (NeGP) . State Data Centre would provide many functionalities and some of the key functionalities are central data repository of the State, Secure Data Storage, Online Delivery of Services, Citizen Information/Services Portal, State Portal, Service Integration etc . These services shall be rendered by the States through a common delivery platform supported by other core infrastructure elements i.e. State Wide Area Network (SWAN) and Common Service Centres (CSC). The State Data Centre is a key supporting element of e -Government initiatives for delivering services to the citizens with greater reliability, availability and serviceability. The State Govt. departments would get a seamless, highly reliable, robust, shared and a secured data centre infrastructure with reaso nable capacity for deploying their e-Governance applications. The State Data Centre s are identified as one of the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) . This document is intended to cover various protocols and procedures to be followed by the Govt. Dep artments for the safe and secure hosting of the websites , applications at the Kerala State Data Centre as soon as when they are ready to deploy . Present Infrastructure of Kerala State Data Centre (KSDC) Government of Kerala have two State Data Centres which were functioning at 4th floor, Co- Bank Towers , Palayam and Thejaswini Building s, Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram district which were established in the year 2005 and 2011. The Kerala State Data Centre (KSDC) would provide a s ecure and physical infrastructure including rack space, power with UPS & generator backup, air conditioning, fire prevention, access control mechanism etc. with a guaranteed minimum uptime of 99.5%. The networking facilities, firewall, Antivirus, storage , load balancers, VPN etc . would be provided for the servers or applications for securely and efficiently delivering the services to web or intranet. Shared infrastructure includes database, application and web servers would enable the Govt. departments to host their e -governance applications. Cloud infrastructure is already in place at both the State Data Centres which would provide dedicated virtual machines to host the applications and the hardware resources can be augmented based on the demand.",
