The Information technology start ups , essentially belong to the second category enterprises discussed above and seem to be bringing about disruptions in the sectors they are emerging. These innovators are today equipped with the power of Internet and developments in Information technology and hardware devices. They seem to be creating a market pull in unexpected directions and the convergence of ICT, mobility and cloud technologies seem to be favouring the same. The thrust effected by re-engineered business models in the concerned sectors has been tremendous.
