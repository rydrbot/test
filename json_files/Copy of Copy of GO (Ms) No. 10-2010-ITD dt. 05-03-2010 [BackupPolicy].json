      "original_text": "e-Governance Data Centre Government of Kerala mm a a a i BACKUP POLICY 1. Overview This policy defines the backup policy for computers co-located in the e- Governance Data Centre, Govt. of Kerala. These systems are typically servers with internal hard disks / disk arrays or SAN / NAS based storages Servers expected to be hacked up include database servers, application servers, web servers, mail servers etc. 2. Purpose This policy is designed to protect data in the computers to be sure it is not lost and can be recovered in the event of an equipment failure, intentional destruction of dala, or disaster in the data centre. 3. Definitions (i) Backup - The saving of files onto magnetic tape or other offline mass storage media for the purpose of preventing loss of data in the event of equipment failure or destruction, (ii) Archival - The saving of old or unused files onto magnetic tape or other offline mass storage media for the purpose of releasing on-line storage room. (iti} Restore - The process of bringing off line storage data back from the offline media =  and pulling it on an online storage system. (iv) Storage replication - Storage replication is a service in which stored or archived data is duplicated in real time over a storage area network. Storage replication service provides an extra measure of redundancy that can be invaluable if the main storage backup system fails. Storage replication may be done in the same storage uray, different storage array/s in the same location or a storage array in a remote location. Immediate access to the replicated data minimizes downtime and its associated costs. The service, if properly implemented, can streamline disaster recovery processes by generating duplicate copies of all backed-up files on a continuous basis. It can also speed up and simplify recovery from a natural or human-caused disaster such as a fire, flood, hurricane, virus, or worm. (v) Disaster Recovery - The process, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of technology infrastructure critical to an organization aller a natural or human induced disaster. Disaster recovery planning is a subset ola larger process known as business continuity planning, and should include planning for resumption of applications, data, hardware, communications (such as networking) and other IT infrastructure. A business continuity plan (BCP) includes planning for non-IT related aspects such as key personnel, facilities, crisis communication and reputation protection, and should refer to the disaster recovery plan (DRP) for [T related infrastructure recovery / continuity.",
