Likewise the Kerala State Wide Area Network (KSWAN), provides connectivity up to Taluk level offices and these entities notified as critical information Infrastructure of the state. In consonance with National Cyber Security Policy, 2013 both the State Data Centers have been ISO 27001 certified and periodic audits of the network infrastructure and co-hosted servers are performed quarterly by Third Party Security auditors, in addition to being subjected to STQC auditing annually. These measures will only ensure security of the cyber infrastructure but the security of the application software is not ensured through the above audits. 2. Currently both the data Centers host around 500 portals / websites / applications catering to the requirement of respective Government Departments/Organizations, These are either developed/managed by Total Solution Provider like NIC, KELTRON, C-DIT or developed and managed by third party companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys etc and perhaps a few by home grown Startup companies. In addition to the web-based applications, Mobile applications (some standalone and some having a corresponding back-end console and reporting functionalities) are also getting developed for the state. In the applications so developed, there exists a possibility of cyber-attack due to flaws in the design, development and deployment of application. The vulnerabilities thus created may be exploited by intruders with malicious intent to cause defacements, data corruption, data/information leakage and disruption in service continuity, threat to data security and privacy.",

      "original_text": "3. In order to mitigate or minimize the cyber threats and to plug the vulnerabilities Government issued the following guidelines with regard to security auditing of websites and web and mobile based e-Governance applications: L III. Any e-Governance application to be hosted at the SDCs or elsewhere shall be security audited before launching in Production and mandates to obtain Safe to host Certification from a CERT-In empanelled Security Auditing agency before opening the application to the public. Security Audits and penetration testing are required to be performed followed by subsequent hardening aimed to mitigate the vulnerabilities and strengthening the security of the applications and their environment. As a policy, all websites / applications hosted at the State Data Centres have to go through a complete security audit process before they can be hosted or whenever an alteration/addition is made to the application. Periodic application security audits shall be done, at least once every two years. The security audit / penetration testing is undertaken at various stages before, during and after hosting. Before hosting, Security audit of Web Application is done as per latest OWASP standard and report is submitted with vulnerabilities that require remediation. A second level testing for verification of whether all the discovered vulnerabilities are patched is also done before Issuance of Certificate of Safe to Host During hosting, Configuration review / SSL deployment, Random Penetration Testing of hosted application etc. also are done. Application Security Audit covers some or all but not limited to the following activities: e Identify the application level vulnerabilities on applications hosted in a test site / production site based on the latest top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities e On demand application scans e An audit of the environment along with the application to ascertain any vulnerability in the environment where the application is hosted. e Password strength on authentication pages e Scan Java Script for security vulnerabilities e File inclusion attacks e Web server information security e Malicious File Uploads e Provide recommendations for remediation of identified vulnerabilities. The report should contain discovered vulnerabilities and description of vulnerabilities and mitigation or remediation recommendations for fixing and patching of existing and found vulnerabilities as a part of solution. e Follow a specific format for reports. e Certify the applications / websites tested as Safe for Hosting and in times if Electronic Payment Gateway Operators request to provide it in their format. e Accept responsibility for declaring the websites / URLs / mobile applications free from known vulnerabilities e Any other activity concerning security audit related aspects; not essentially covered by work-areas outlined above.",

As part of any audit engagement, the approved vendors may submit detailed proposals including: 1. Details of different tests/ audits to be performed, standards against which the audits will be performed etc. 2. Details to include specific systems/ subsystems to be audited and what activities will be performed in the subsystems. 3. Clear component-wise cost estimate including: - e Manpower rate and effort estimate in number of man-days, if Security audit includes items other than Application/ Web service/ Mobile App/ Server/ Network Security Audit. e Schedule for completion of the work. Application security audit cost is impacted by the correctness of parameters such as Number of Static/ Dynamic Pages, Number of Input Forms, Number of input data fields, Number of user roles etc. These should be recorded by the department through the Development team in scoping sheet and provided to the vendor. The vendor may be provided test user credentials (if applicable) on the application on test server in order to corroborate the same. Any discrepancies between the developer provided data and vendor provided data may be mutually sorted out before reaching an agreement on the scope and further submission of cost proposal by the vendor.
