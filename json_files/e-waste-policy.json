      "original_text": "~ 2 electro-magnetic fields to be fully functional and the definition for e-waste is waste electrical und electronic equipment. whole or in part or rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, which are intended to be discarded. Also in sub-rule (1) of rule 13 it is specified that Every producer of electrical and electronic equipment listed in schedule 1 shall ensure that, new electrical and electronic equipment does not contain Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, exavalent Chromium, polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers: Provided that a maximum concentration value of U1 % by weight in homogenous materials for lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyls ethers and of 0.01 % by weight in homogenous materials for cadmium shall be permitted. In sub-rule (3) of rule 13 it is specified that the sub-rule (1) of rule 13 shall not apply to components of electrical and electronic equipment manufactured or placed in the market six years before the date of commencement of these rules. These rules are applicable to the electrical and electronic equipment specified in schedule J. The applications listed in schedule II shall be exempted from provisions of sub-rule (1) of rule 13. This does not mean that schedule II is exempted from e-waste (Management and Ilandling) Rules, 2011. Putting the onus of re-cycling of electronics wastes (e-wastes) on the producers, the rules make the e-waste producers liable for recycling and reducing e-waste in the country. The rules cover discarded IT and telecoms equipment and consumer electrical goods and encompass the concept of Extended Producers Responsibility or the Polluter Pays Principle which as applicable in relation of e-wastes, makes the producers to take responsibility for the disposal of end-of-life products. Personal Computer manufacturers, mubile handset makers and the white goods makers will be required to come up with e-waste collection centers or introduce take back systems. These rules will apply to every producer, and bulk consumer involved in manufacture, sales. purchase and processing of electronic equipment or components. 2. According to the\"2011 Census around 32.6% of the households in Kerala have both land line and mobile phone connectivity, while the national average is only 11.7%, Kerala has 20.4% computer connectivity, as against national average of 18.7%. e-wastes are fast becoming a major solid waste sueam in the State. Among them Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and Fluorescent Tube Lights (FTL) engage special attention and disposal tactics due to the mercury contained in them. The following types of wastes are generated from the fluorescent lamp sector: 3 (i) Glass Waste (with and without mercury} (it) Waste phosphor powder (ii) Waste mercury (in liquid and vapour phase) (iv) Waste electronic and plastic components. Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) and Fluorescent Tube Lights (FTL) due to its mercury content pose health risk if handled carelessly, as mercury may enter living systems causing irreversible damages and may even prove to be fatal. The CPCB guidelines specify that the waste generated at the manufacturers end shal] be stered and treated/recycled either in a recycling unit at the production site or any authorized Lamp Recycling Unit and all hazardous waste thereof shall be sent to Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF) set up as per the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Transboundary) Rules, 2008. Mercury emissions are strictly controjled during the manufacturing stage of CFL&FTL and stringent measures should be followed by units at the time of disposal of hazardous wastes containing mercury. At present fused CFLs /FTLs are posing a difficult situation to manage by local bodies since it is being dumped into municipal solid waste dumping sites very carelessly by the public and is endangering public health. This situation has warranted the Government to evolve a proper procedure to collect fused CFLs/FTLs and dispose them of scientifically and safely. The way forward for consumers would be turning in old mercury lamps of all types particularly conventional Fluorescent Tube Lights and CFLs to ensure proper transport and disposal availing the service of the Ministry of Environment authorized agencies for collection and storage of e-wastes, avoiding situations creating direct contact of broken CFLs and FTLs by users and others. 3. Since Kerala doesnt have an e-waste disposal plant, the waste goes into the unorganized market for crude dismantling, recovery and reuse. This create several occupational health hazards. As the States consumption pattern increases, scientific management of e-waste becomes very critical. The problem of e-waste has been growing rapidly in the State and the end users especially offices and residents are facing practical difficulties in disposing of them in an environmentally sound manner. 4. In the matter of safe collection, storage, transportation and scientific disposal of the e-wastes generated in the State, Government issue the following orders for strict and urgent compliance by all concerned: pone",

      "original_text": "(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) 4 Producers of e-wastes shall be responsible for collection, transportation and disposal in the prescribed mamicr. of all e-wastes generated by them or bought back by them from consumers under the Extended Producer Responsibility cither directly or through autharized agents. The e-wastes thus collected <iall be delivered to autborived recyclers by the producers themsely es. sinder appropriate arrangenients, Consumers of branded electrical and electronic equipments which have became e-wastes may return it to the producer either through invoking EPR? or dispose it through local collection mechanisms if any arranged for by Local Self Government Institutions, in the manner crdered in para 4(v) below. The State Pollution Contro] Board shall take sleps to get the firms dismantling or recycling within the State to be registered and to have consents for operation and scientific disposal of the e-wastes collected. The Board, Department of Envircnment and Climate Change and Kerala State Council for Science Technolog: and Environment shall include management and disposal as above of -wastes, in the integrated environment awareness programmes being organized by them and in the environmental programmes being sponsored by them. There are several items which do not have EPR facility, for which specia] arrangements need to be made. Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2000 mandates nwnicipal bodies to provide proper collection, treatment and dispusal facilities for Manicipal Waste Management (MSW) including segregation of toxic materiais and substances. Often broken CFLs and FPLs are put up in the house hold solid wastes harming those who collect the same and those handling it at disposal facilities. As proper collection, storage and transportation of c-wasles is of direct consequence to the LSGIs they may provide the required basic facility for house hold level segregated collection and local storage of e-wastes to be taken fo reprocessing units by registered agencies. Local Self Government Institutions may provide the minimum required storage facilities for the e-wastes to be collected from the ward level residential/commercial areas aad thase segregaied from the MSW (v3} (vii Waste Electronie/Electrical Material > and also facilities for centralized collection of e-wastes from the local collection centers. Kudumbasree units could be engaged for door-to-door collection of segregated e-wastes including electrical appliances, CFL and FTL. Forward linkages are now available for collection from central collection points in urban areas, to be taken to dismantling and disposal] units. Space may be arranged near local markets or landed properties owned by LSGIs, from where the wastes can be collected and stored at a central collection point [or each LSGI, to be taken delivery of by the accredited state level agencies for collection and transportation and disposal or to collect and transport to centralized disposal facilities. Thequestion of paymient of some monetary incentives to those who collect income generating e-wastes from house holds, by the state level agencies to be engaged can also be considered. for which the LSGIs providing space for centralized storage may negotiate with such agencies. Some recyclers extend the facility of entermg into agreement with corporate and .Government organizations to collect, transport and dispose of e-wastes. They may aiso give incative for the types of e-wastes which will provide them income on reprocessing. Each category may have different rate depending on its recyclable value. Usually the following e-wastes are eligible for payment by registered recyclers/authorized collection agents.
