Knowledge based innovation and Entrepreneurship The Science and Technology driven Innovation comes under a broad category of innovation definition called Knowledge based Innovation. It is critical to bring in this definition as we are in a Knowledge economy and there are other factors which impact the development of Science and technology based inventions and breakthroughs to a land. The Information technology start ups, essentially belong to the second category enterprises discussed above and seem to be bringing about disruptions in the sectors they are emerging. These innovators are today equipped with the power of Internet and developments in Information technology and hardware devices. They seem to be creating a market pull in unexpected directions and the convergence of ICT, mobility and cloud technologies seem to be favoring the same. The thrust effected by re-engineered business models in the concerned sectors has been tremendous. In hospitality we have the largest accommodation provider who doesnt own a property and in Media we have the largest media company, which doesnt have a production facility. These were models unthought-of or written off not too long ago and similar disruptions are happening in education, healthcare and all such sectors. 1.2, Kerala Technology Startup Policy Kerala Technology Start-Up Policy now in place unfolds the broad framework for creation of a startup ecosystem in technology based startups across sectors in state of Kerala. The Policy is split into nine sections that are the strategic building blocks towards a world-class startup ecosystem viz., Infrastructure, Incubators and Accelerators, Human Capital Development, Funding, State Support, Governance, Public Private Partnership, Scaling Existing and Establishing New Incubators and Startup-Bootup-Scaleup model for moving fast from ideas to IPO. 1.3. Kerala Start UP Mission Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) the nodal agency of Government of Kerala for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in Kerala.

Technology innovation Zone Government of Kerala is establishing the Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, a global innovation incubator hub for multiple domains and technology sectors under a single roof. The zone will create world-class infrastructure facilities for multi sector technology incubators to incubate their start-ups and to support home grown enterprises. We also expect the cross pollination of ideas and technology breakthroughs to trigger high value innovations/startups. Kerala Technology Innovation Zone is envisioned as a one stop shop for technology innovation, where everything from the consolidating of the idea, to its incubation, to mentor support for setting up a successful enterprise and even a squadron of angel investors ready to invest- in a bankable idea is present. The TIZ acts as a Self- sustained ecosystem which serves all the interests of the young innovators and entrepreneurs, so that all the time and energy that they have, goes into product development and not the peripherals such as worrying about the Jaw and lack of funding or infrastructural support. 3.3.  Fab Kerala Network Govt. of Kerala through Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has setup two Fablabs each at Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram and Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, Kochi. Fablab Thiruvananthapuram is located at the ground floor of Indian Institute of Information Technology Management (IITM-K), Fablab Kochi is located in the ground floor of Water Tank Building, Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, KINFRA Hitch Park, Kochi. By setting up the Fablab Kerala Network it is envisaged to encourage the innovation, technology development, product prototyping, maker learning, and commerciziable product developnient. This will empower the maker-entrepreneurial culture, which at present is confined to ICT/ electronics domain. The Fablab programme will lead to a cross learning culture among multiple technology sectors and create a robust platform for the upcoming entrepreneurs to create indigenous technology products. The Kerala fablabs are a support facility for the maker community comprising of student, -startups, entrepreneurs, corporates, individual makers, research groups, academic institutions and universities across India. The Kerala Fablabs has a vibrant ecosystem for creating a maker culture among the young techno-entrepreneurs, who want to ae",

These Fab Labs will be based on Educational institutions and closely adhere to the university's idea of bringing out makers with proven skills in design , development and fabrication. Mini Fab Labs will work closely with the Fab Labs to take advantage of the Fab Network , Fab Academy and other Fab Lab based initiatives. Makers based on Mini Fab Labs are allowed to connect to Fab Lab based makers / Fab Gurus at any point of time through a dedicated channel. This will also make it quite easy to get maker certifications from the Fab Guru, which is a value addition to the degree certificate. Students/individuals based on Mini Fab Labs will also get the opportunity to work at Fab Labs and get them certified as Fab Gurus. Apart from the Mini fablabs, the Kerala Fab Academy envisages to create open maker spaces in the state. The open maker space will have all the basic machines for prototyping and will be accessible to public.

KSUM shall focus on Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship and the elements of triggering such innovation are expected to come out of the Academic institutions, R&D centers, Society in general (societal problems) and Rural innovators , involved in jugad innovations. We are establishing a clear stream of activities connecting the technical universities and academia at large which will help scout innovations nurture them and bring them to a level of commercialization. On the other end we have R&D institutions and agencies working on cutting edge technologies that are creating intellectual property and advancements in varioius technologies for their own research or operations. These advancements however do not come out for the common good of the society nor does it translate to commercial businesses. The system will have provisions to capture such latent talents and innovations and bring them to the forefront. The biggest triggering force of commercially successful business is a societal pain point, every time an innovation addresses a problem faced by the public in a way better than it is being done currently there isa ready market/ opportunity.

This will benefit them to increase their rate of innovation in the business. One way of doing it is like donating companys patent to an independent, third party organization, put them in a common pool or grant unlimited license to use to anybody. Brining in open innovation can create competitive advantage at the level of business in which ideas for innovations can emerge or go to market from outside the company as well as inside or extended to a regional level. This will aid in the exploitation of intellectual capital and making new technology products. Government shall encourage and incentivize open innovation attempts by corporates and shall facilitate the same through creation of requisite infrastructure and funding. 6.
